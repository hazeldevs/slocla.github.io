			<p> &emsp; &emsp; Mrs. Slocomb, I am honored to have been not only a student but a friend of yours. Running every day sucked (really hard), but the banter that
			we would have would always make it more than tolerable, almost enjoyable. Your somewhat sarcastic, playful teaching style made P.E. a very fun class for me to 
			be a part of. The jokes that were made will always be in the back of my mind, and despite the fact that I probably won't be a competitive baseball player anymore,
			I am at least glad to have helped guide you through the process of involving your son.</p>
